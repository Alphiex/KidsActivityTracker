# Deployment Status Summary

## ‚úÖ Code Changes Completed

### 1. Fixed Location Browse Functionality
- **Backend**: Updated `/api/v1/locations` endpoint to only return locations with active activities
- **Frontend**: Modified LocationBrowseScreen to fetch from API instead of loading all activities
- **Result**: Will show all locations with activities (not just 2) once deployed

### 2. Fixed Instructor Field Extraction
- **Scraper**: Updated regex to prevent capturing course descriptions as instructor names
- **Validation**: Only 6 activities had incorrect instructor data that needs updating

### 3. Fixed Activity Cost Updates
- **Service**: Fixed ID matching logic to properly update existing activities
- **Verified**: Cost updates now work correctly when scraper runs

## üöß Deployment Issues

### GitHub Actions Deployment
The automated deployment is failing due to missing Google Cloud credentials:
```
Error: the GitHub Action workflow must specify exactly one of 
"workload_identity_provider" or "credentials_json"!
```

**Required Action**: Repository owner needs to add `GCP_SA_KEY` secret in GitHub repository settings.

## üìã Next Steps

### 1. Fix GitHub Actions Deployment
Add the following secret to the repository:
- Go to Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
- Add secret named `GCP_SA_KEY` with the service account JSON key

### 2. Alternative: Manual Deployment
If GitHub Actions cannot be fixed immediately:

```bash
# Build and deploy manually
cd backend
gcloud builds submit --config=cloudbuild-api-only.yaml
```

### 3. Verify Deployment
Once deployed, run:
```bash
cd backend
node test-browse-buttons.js
```

This will verify all browse functionality is working correctly.

### 4. Run Enhanced Scraper
After API is deployed:
```bash
cd backend
node run-production-scraper.js
```

This will update all activities with:
- Corrected instructor fields
- Updated costs
- Enhanced details (sessions, prerequisites, etc.)

## üìä Current Status

- **Code**: ‚úÖ All fixes merged to main branch
- **Tests**: ‚úÖ Passing locally
- **Deployment**: ‚ùå Blocked on missing GCP credentials
- **API**: ‚ùå Still returning old responses (not deployed)
- **Scraper**: ‚è∏Ô∏è Ready to run once API is deployed

## üîç Testing

### Test Location Browse (after deployment):
1. Open the app
2. Tap "Browse by Location" 
3. Should see ~17 locations (not just 2)
4. Tap a location to see its activities

### Test API Directly:
```bash
curl https://kids-activity-api-44042034457.us-central1.run.app/api/v1/locations
```

Should return locations with activity counts once deployed.
