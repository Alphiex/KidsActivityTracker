# API Changes Ready for Deployment

## Summary
The location browse functionality has been fixed. The API now returns only locations with active activities and includes activity counts, which the mobile app uses to display locations efficiently.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Location API Endpoint (`/api/v1/locations`)
- **File**: `backend/src/routes/reference.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Only returns locations that have active activities
  - Includes activity count for each location
  - Filters out bad location data (descriptions stored as names)
  - Returns clean location objects with all fields

### 2. Updated Frontend LocationBrowseScreen
- **File**: `src/screens/LocationBrowseScreen.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Now calls locations API endpoint instead of loading all activities
  - Fetches activities for a specific location only when selected
  - Shows loading state while fetching location-specific activities
  - Improved performance by not loading all activities upfront

## Deployment Steps

The API changes need to be deployed via GitHub Actions:

1. **Commit and push the changes**:
   ```bash
   git add backend/src/routes/reference.ts src/screens/LocationBrowseScreen.tsx
   git commit -m "fix: location browse now shows all locations with proper activity counts"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **GitHub Actions will automatically**:
   - Run tests
   - Build Docker image
   - Deploy to Google Cloud Run
   - Run health checks

3. **Verify deployment**:
   ```bash
   # Test the locations endpoint
   curl https://kids-activity-api-205843686007.us-central1.run.app/api/v1/locations
   ```

## Testing

After deployment, test the location browse functionality:

1. Open the app
2. Tap "Browse by Location"
3. Should see all locations with activity counts (not just 2)
4. Tap on a location to see its activities
5. Activities should load for that specific location

## API Response Format

The locations endpoint now returns:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "locations": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "name": "North Vancouver Recreation Centre",
      "address": "123 Main St",
      "city": "North Vancouver",
      "province": "BC",
      "postalCode": "V7M 1A1",
      "facility": "Recreation Centre",
      "activityCount": 45
    },
    // ... more locations
  ]
}
```

## Notes
- The API currently returns a 500 error because the changes haven't been deployed yet
- Once deployed, the app will show all locations with active activities
- Performance is improved as activities are loaded on-demand per location
