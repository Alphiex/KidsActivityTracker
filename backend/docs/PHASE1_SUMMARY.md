# Phase 1 Implementation Summary

## What's Been Completed

### 1. Enhanced Database Schema Design (`schema-v2.prisma`)
- ✅ Added unique constraint on `providerId + externalId` for activities
- ✅ Added `isActive` and `lastSeenAt` fields for lifecycle management
- ✅ Designed complete schema for users, children, and sharing features
- ✅ Added audit tables for tracking changes and scraper runs

### 2. Enhanced Scraper (`enhancedNvrcScraper.js`)
- ✅ Uses `courseId` as `externalId` for unique identification
- ✅ Marks all activities inactive before scraping
- ✅ Updates existing activities instead of creating duplicates
- ✅ Marks found activities as active with updated `lastSeenAt`
- ✅ Purges activities older than 12 months that are inactive
- ✅ Tracks detailed statistics for each scraper run
- ✅ Improved cost parsing to handle decimal places correctly

### 3. Enhanced Activity Service (`activityService.enhanced.ts`)
- ✅ Filters out inactive activities by default
- ✅ Optional `includeInactive` parameter for admin use
- ✅ New methods for getting activities by provider and courseId
- ✅ Activity history tracking
- ✅ Provider statistics

## Key Improvements

### Activity Uniqueness
```javascript
// Activities are now uniquely identified by:
providerId + externalId (courseId from provider)

// This prevents duplicates when re-scraping
```

### Activity Lifecycle
```
1. Before scraping: All activities → inactive
2. During scraping: Found activities → active
3. After scraping: Old inactive activities → deleted
```

### Cost Fix Applied
- Updated regex pattern to handle costs with 1 or 2 decimal places
- Bulk updated incorrect costs in the database
- Tournament programs now show correct prices (e.g., $2,642.50)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Needed

1. **Deploy Database Changes**
   ```bash
   # Create migration for new schema
   npx prisma migrate dev --name add_activity_lifecycle
   
   # Deploy to production
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```

2. **Test Enhanced Scraper**
   ```bash
   # Run locally first
   node scrapers/enhancedNvrcScraper.js
   
   # Check results
   # Verify no duplicates created
   # Verify inactive activities marked
   # Verify old activities purged
   ```

3. **Update API Endpoints**
   - Replace current activity service with enhanced version
   - Ensure all endpoints filter inactive activities
   - Add admin endpoints for viewing inactive activities

### Phase 2: User Authentication System

The next major phase involves:

1. **User Account Management**
   - Registration with email verification
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Password reset functionality
   - Profile management

2. **API Security**
   - Add authentication middleware
   - Protect existing endpoints
   - Add user context to requests

3. **Database Migration**
   - Migrate local preferences to cloud
   - Link existing favorites to user accounts

### Phase 3: Children & Activity Tracking

After authentication is in place:

1. **Children Profiles**
   - CRUD operations for children
   - Age-based activity filtering
   - Avatar and preferences

2. **Activity-Child Relationships**
   - Mark activities as interested/registered/completed
   - Track per-child activity history
   - Calendar view of upcoming activities

### Phase 4: Sharing System

The most complex feature:

1. **Invitation System**
   - Email-based invitations
   - Token-based acceptance
   - Invitation expiry

2. **Granular Permissions**
   - Control what information is shared
   - Per-child sharing settings
   - Revocable access

3. **Shared Views**
   - See friend's activities
   - Privacy-respecting queries
   - Activity recommendations

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority** (Weeks 1-4)
   - Deploy activity lifecycle changes
   - Implement user authentication
   - Basic children profiles

2. **Medium Priority** (Weeks 5-8)
   - Activity-child relationships
   - Activity history tracking
   - Enhanced search filters

3. **Lower Priority** (Weeks 9-12)
   - Sharing system
   - Invitation management
   - Social features

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Activity queries should use indexes on `isActive`
- Consider caching for frequently accessed data
- Pagination for large result sets

### Security
- All user data must be properly authenticated
- Sharing permissions must be enforced at API level
- No data leakage between users

### Mobile App Updates
- Will require significant state management changes
- New screens for user auth and children
- Offline support considerations

## Testing Requirements

1. **Scraper Testing**
   - Verify no duplicate activities
   - Test activity updates
   - Verify purge logic

2. **API Testing**
   - Ensure inactive activities not returned
   - Test search filters
   - Performance testing

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Full scraper run
   - API endpoint coverage
   - Mobile app compatibility
