## Technical Requirements

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Categories table (if doesn't exist)
CREATE TABLE Category (
  id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  description VARCHAR,
  ageMin INT,
  ageMax INT,
  requiresParent BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  displayOrder INT,
  createdAt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updatedAt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Activity-Category junction table
CREATE TABLE ActivityCategory (
  id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
  activityId VARCHAR REFERENCES Activity(id),
  categoryId VARCHAR REFERENCES Category(id),
  createdAt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(activityId, categoryId)
);
```

### API Endpoints Required
- `GET /api/v1/activities/recommended` - User preference-based activities
- `GET /api/v1/locations/cities` - Cities with counts
- `GET /api/v1/locations/:cityId/venues` - Venues in city with counts  
- `GET /api/v1/activities/favorites` - User's favorited activities
- `GET /api/v1/activities/new` - Activities from last 7 days
- `GET /api/v1/activities/budget-friendly` - Activities within budget
- `GET /api/v1/activity-types` - Activity types with counts
- `GET /api/v1/activity-types/:id/subtypes` - Subtypes with counts
- `GET /api/v1/categories` - Categories with counts
- `GET /api/v1/categories/:id/activities` - Activities in category

### Global Filters Implementation
- Must be applied consistently across all features (except Favourites)
- Include in both count queries and result queries
- Filters: Activity Types, Age Groups, Locations, Budget, Schedule
- Always show "X activities shown, Y filtered out by global filters" in headers

### Pagination Requirements
- 50 results per page for all activity lists
- Implement infinite scroll or "Load More" functionality
- Ensure counts always match between dashboard and result pages

## Validation Checklist
Before deploying any dashboard changes, verify:

- [ ] Counts match between dashboard and result pages
- [ ] Pagination works with 50 results per page

## Future Considerations
- Categories table designed to support additional categories

- Clear separation between Categories and Activity Types maintained
