4. **No Text:** Avoid text in the icon (App Store guidelines)
5. **Consistent Style:** Each set should have cohesive design language

- [ ] Recognizable on light and dark wallpapers
- [ ] Stands out among other apps
- [ ] Reflects app purpose (kids activities)

## Naming Convention

Files should be named:
- `icon-{size}.png` (e.g., `icon-1024.png`, `icon-180.png`)
- Or `AppIcon-{size}.png` for iOS-specific naming

## Next Steps

1. Use these prompts with DALL-E, Midjourney, or hire a designer
2. Generate all sizes for each set
3. Review on actual device at different sizes
4. Select favorite design
5. Update iOS project with chosen icon set
