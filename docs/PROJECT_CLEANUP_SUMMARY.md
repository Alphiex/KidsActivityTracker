# Project Cleanup Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Organized Directory Structure
```
KidsActivityTracker/
├── src/                      # React Native source code
├── backend/                  # Backend API code  
├── ios/                      # iOS native code
├── android/                  # Android native code
├── assets/                   # Images, fonts, etc
├── docs/                     # All documentation
│   ├── api/                  # API documentation
│   ├── guides/               # Setup and deployment guides
│   ├── screenshots/          # All screenshots (40+ files)
│   └── architecture/         # Architecture docs
├── scripts/                  # Build and utility scripts
│   ├── data/                 # Data migration scripts (15+ files)
│   ├── build/                # Build scripts
│   └── utils/                # Utility scripts (4+ files)
├── tests/                    # Test files
│   ├── unit/                 # Unit tests
│   ├── integration/          # Integration tests
│   └── fixtures/             # Test data
├── temp/                     # Temporary files (git-ignored)
└── archive/                  # Old/archived files (git-ignored)
```

### 2. Files Moved/Organized

#### Screenshots (40+ files moved to docs/screenshots/)
- All .png files including debug screenshots, NVRC screenshots, results screenshots, etc.

#### Documentation (20+ files moved to docs/)
- API docs moved to docs/api/
- Setup guides moved to docs/guides/
- Architecture docs moved to docs/architecture/
- Other documentation moved to docs/

#### Scripts (20+ files organized)
- Data scripts moved to scripts/data/
- Utility scripts moved to scripts/utils/

#### Archived Files (15+ files)
- All App.*.tsx backup files
- All index.*.js backup files
- All nvrc_*.json/txt/html temporary files

### 3. Xcode Project Updates
- Added folder references for docs/, scripts/, backend/, tests/, src/
- These folders are now visible in Xcode navigator for easy access
- Folders are references only (blue folders) - not compiled

### 4. .gitignore Updates
- Added archive/ directory to gitignore
- Added temp/ directory to gitignore

## Before and After

**Before:** 159 items in root directory
**After:** 44 items in root directory

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Structure** - Easy to find files and understand project organization
2. **Xcode Visibility** - All project files visible in Xcode, not just compiled sources
3. **Better Git History** - Temporary files no longer clutter git
4. **Easier Navigation** - Related files grouped together logically

## Future File Creation Guidelines

When creating new files, please use these directories:

- **React Native Components/Screens** → `src/`
- **Backend/API Files** → `backend/`
- **Documentation** → `docs/` (in appropriate subdirectory)
- **Build/Utility Scripts** → `scripts/` (in appropriate subdirectory)
- **Test Files** → `tests/` (in appropriate subdirectory)
- **Temporary Files** → `temp/` (automatically ignored by git)
- **Images/Assets** → `assets/` or `src/assets/`

## Cleanup Complete!

The project is now well-organized and all files are accessible through Xcode.
