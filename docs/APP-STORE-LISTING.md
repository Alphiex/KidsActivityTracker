### Review Notes

```
Kids Activity Tracker helps Canadian parents find activities for their children from recreation centers across 73 cities.

KEY POINTS FOR REVIEWERS:

1. CHILD PROFILES: Parents create profiles for their children with birthdate, interests, allergies, and special needs. This information is used solely for filtering age-appropriate activities and providing personalized recommendations. Parents control all data.

2. FAMILY SHARING: Parents can share child profiles with co-parents, grandparents, and caregivers via email invitation. Recipients can view schedules and favorites. This is designed for family coordination, not social networking.

3. AI RECOMMENDATIONS: The app uses AI to parse natural language searches and provide personalized activity recommendations. No personal data is shared with external AI services - recommendations are generated by our backend.

4. SUBSCRIPTIONS: Premium features (unlimited profiles, calendar export, alerts) are managed through RevenueCat following all Apple guidelines. Free tier is fully functional with limitations (2 children, 10 favorites).

5. LOCATION: Location is used to show nearby activities and enable distance filtering. Users can manually enter locations if they decline location access. Saved locations (home, work, etc.) are stored locally.

6. ACCOUNT DELETION: Full account deletion is available in Settings > Account > Delete Account. This permanently removes all user data including child profiles, favorites, and calendar data.

7. DATA SOURCES: Activity data is aggregated from public recreation center websites across Canada. We link directly to official registration pages - we do not process registrations or payments.

8. TESTING THE APP:
   - Create a child profile to see personalized recommendations
   - Use the AI search: "Swimming lessons for a 6 year old"
   - Try distance filter: Set to 10km to see nearby activities
   - Add activities to favorites and calendar
