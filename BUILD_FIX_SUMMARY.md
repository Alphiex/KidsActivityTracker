# Build Fix Summary

## Issue
The app failed to compile with "Command PhaseScriptExecution failed with a nonzero exit code" error.

## Root Cause
The `ActivityDetailScreenEnhanced.tsx` file was importing `react-native-maps` which wasn't installed as a dependency.

## Solution Applied
1. Commented out the MapView import in `ActivityDetailScreenEnhanced.tsx`
2. Replaced the MapView component with a placeholder that shows:
   - Location icon
   - "Map View Available" text
   - GPS coordinates
   - Get Directions button (still functional)

## Result
âœ… The app now compiles successfully

## To Enable Maps (Optional)
If you want to add the map functionality:

1. Run `./install-maps.sh` to install react-native-maps
2. Uncomment the MapView import
3. Replace the map placeholder with the actual MapView code
4. Add Google Maps API keys for iOS and Android

## Clean Build Script
If you encounter other build issues, use:
```bash
./clean-build.sh
```

This will clean all caches and rebuild the project from scratch.
